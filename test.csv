Please post any questions not suitable for their own thread here. All subreddit rules still apply, please report any rulebreaking content. 

**Note:** The subreddit is not nearly as active as launches in the past, so we will be lenient on people making threads for questions they might have, but if it's really, truly a question undeserving of it's own thread, please ask here.

Please upvote good questions and good answers. 

**Also please remember;** this subreddit is not affiliated with  Kakao in any way. We cannot help with account support questions, tell you why you were banned, or give you free copies of the game.
shittymoviedetails No more meta-reddit attack postsLately the subreddit has been slowly moving towards "Moviedetails upvoted this post and it is a shit post" material. 

That is not what this sub is about. 

Content for this subreddit should be fun, lighthearted, humorous. 

If posters on other subreddits get harassed as a result of posts made on here then the sub can get in trouble and we could get sanctioned or shut down. 

A new rule will be added, a clarification to rule 2: "Be nice".

**No meta-reddit attack posts**

No posts that are about or mention other subreddits, posts or users, either in the title, as a top level comment or visible on the image. 

This subreddit is a place to be silly, to be inventive, to make people smile. 

It's fine to take an image from another subreddit and alter the original meaning via a novel title. A play on words, a subverted expectation, a meme or a joke. 

It is no longer allowed to directly mention other users or subreddits or to make mean-spirited posts like "Look what these people upvoted haha they're bad".
