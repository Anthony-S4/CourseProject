Costco Christmas DinnersI saw posts around thanksgiving showing ready to reheat turkey dinners with all the fixings. Do the clubs do something similar at Christmas as well?  (Philly area if it is relevant)

atheism I’m from turkey and Erdoğan is trying to get rid of secularism that Atatürk bought

Erdoğan’s literally the worst leader of Turkey ever

He Islamized our country

He is very corrupt, we literally lost 128 billion dollars because of him

He caused the economic crisis and high inflation 

He ruined our alliance with the west and Israel

He allowed Arab immigrants into our country

He’s trying to legalize child marriages

He ban Gay prides and supporting LGBT rights 

He removed pro-women laws

He turned all public schools into religious schools to brainwash Turkish kids


He recognized “Palestine” as a state and he supported them 


He doesn’t want us to join EU

He funds Islamist terrorists groups


He’s openly misogynist, homophobic and kafirphobic 


He never supported our Uighur Turkic brothers, in fact he supports China



He is the biggest threat to our secularism
AmItheAsshole AITA for ruining thanksgiving?
I (30f) met my bf (30m) 3 years ago. Before me he was together with his HS sweetheart. They fell out of love and broke up. A year later we started dating. His mom however was still heartbroken about it. I was very understanding and thought she needed time to get to know me. The ex basically grew up with them and they saw her as a part of the family. 

For the first year of my relationship his mom would call me ex’s name, until bf got angry once and told her to be nice. She laughed it off and said it was just a habit. After that she started calling me the wrong name. (Janet instead of Jenny; fictional names just for the story). I corrected her a couple of times but she seemed to like hurting me so I ignored it later.

My bf has two sisters and a couple of weeks before thanksgiving we were invited to bbq at the older sister’s house. I was in the kitchen with my bf’s mom, the sisters and one of their husbands. The older sister then talked about how my BF praised my cooking to her husband and the mom was listening. She then said iut loud “SURE! Why don’t we let Janet make the turkey this year?”. The sisters giggled and looked at each other and I said “thats a great idea!” I didn’t tell my bf what happened.

On thanksgiving we went to his mom’s house with the usual wine and dessert. She was shocked l, everybody was shocked. I said “what? I thought Janet is bringing the turkey!”. There was yelling, crying and then we got kicked out. My bf is so angry with me he hasn’t talked to me since. I think it’s over tbh. But I still don’t think I did anything wrong! Did I?
