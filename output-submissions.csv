NoStupidQuestions,"November 2021 Covid-19 Pandemic megathreadThe Spanish Flu pandemic lasted for 27 months between February 1918, when it was declared a pandemic, and April 1920, when the pandemic was declared over. If Covid takes the same path, we only have another...8 months to go. 

Crap.

Welcome to yet *another* monthly megathread for Covid-19. We get so many questions every month about it, like *""If vaccinated people can still spread the virus, why do stores care if you have been vaccinated?""* or *""Does getting Covid give the same immunity as getting vaccinated?""*  ..and many of them are repeats. So we made a megathread where you can ask these questions! 

**Post all your Covid-19 related questions as a top level reply** to this monthly post.

**Top level comments are still subject to the normal NoStupidQuestions rules**:

* We get a lot of repeats - **please search before you ask your question** *(Ctrl-F is your friend!)*. You can also search [earlier megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/search/?q=flair%3A%22Covid-19+megathread%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) for popular questions like *""how can I convince my friend the vaccine is safe?""* or *""when do you think the pandemic will end?""*
* **Be civil** to each other - which includes not discriminating against any group of people or using slurs of any kind. Topics like this can be very important to people, or even a matter of life and death, so let's not add fuel to the fire.
* **Top level comments must be genuine questions**, not disguised rants or loaded questions. This isn't a sub for scoring points, it's about learning.
* **Keep your questions tasteful and legal.** Reddit's minimum age is just *13!* 
* Worried you have the virus or how to treat it? **All medical advice questions will be removed.** If you have a question about your personal health, *talk to your doctor.* Absolutely *must* ask strangers online? Try /r/AskDocs.

NoStupidQuestions,"November 2021 U.S. Government and Politics megathreadIt's November, so that means election month! Voters in New Jersey and Virginia get to choose their governors - and the Supreme Court continues to make rulings, Congress continues to pass laws and fight over budgets, and Presidents and ex-Presidents continue to make news. And inspire questions.

Every single day /r/NoStupidQuestions gets multiple questions like *""What does 'Let's Go Brandon' mean?""* or *""Why are the Democrats opposed to getting rid of the Filibuster?""*  It turns out that many of those questions are the *same* ones! By request, we now have a monthly megathread to collect all those questions in one convenient spot.

leagueoflegends,"2021 LCS and LEC Roster Rumors/Changes Megathread###Live thread is, well, live: https://www.reddit.com/live/17zgfe4sd0pkg/

---

Ladies and Gentlemen...welcome...to [Roster-mania!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrOemQaEJGU)

Here is a resource for all the teams, their rosters, and their coaches. I will update this continually throughout the next few days/weeks/whatever. Please feel free to correct the information in this post if you see something wrong and if I miss any updates.

#[READ THIS FIRST:](https://redd.it/hz3bix) This megathread is meant to be a central hub for roster change news as well as general discussion surrounding roster changes.

TL,DR:

* Rumors from ""journalistic"" sources and industry insiders are allowed to be submitted. Random sources from twitter, reddit, etc. are not allowed.
* Rumors that are proven or dis-proven while still on the front page will be removed.
* If a rumor is confirmed while on the front page, it will be removed and stickied on the confirmation post.
* Any general off-season roster moves discussion will be redirected to this megathread.

#You can also discuss all of these things over in /r/lolesports or [#esports on our discord server](https://discord.gg/lol).

###I will only include information from journalists, teams themselves, and information within Riot's contract database. Click on the name for link confirmation. Players with no link have a contract according to the [Riot Global Contract Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7k5kQ2AegbuyiGwEPsa62e883FYVtHqr6UVut9RC4o/pubhtml#), and have no outstanding rumors/confirmations at this time.

####I will also be removing players confirmed not to be in the LCS/LEC/NA Academy next split.

leagueoflegends,I really like the new animation for control wards that shows you the reveal rangeI haven't seen anyone mention this change yet and I'm not sure it was included in the patch notes but there's a new animation when you place control wards. When you place a control ward there is now a small blue kind of shockwave that shows the reveal range of the control ward and it is a really subtle change but it is the kind of thing that makes a difference and is really pleasant to see.

PublicFreakout,"/r/PublicFreakout is now accepting applications for new comment moderators.Hello all,

As many have noticed the subreddit continues to grow at a rapid pace due to world events and we are quickly approaching the 4 million member mark.

In that context, over the past few months many of you have reached out to us via modmail with offers to join the mod team and, during that time period, we asked each applicant to keep an eye out for a sticky thread of this nature. 

As such, while we are in need of moderators sooner rather than later, we have decided that we will still go through with this application process in the interest of fairness to those who had previously reached out seeking a spot on the team.

To be considered, please fill out the following form (no email address required) and ensure you spell your reddit username exactly as it appears on reddit (include any hyphens, underscores, etc).

funny,"ANNOUNCEMENT: We're making some changes to how comics are handled.Hey, folks!

The moderators of /r/Funny have been hearing some concerns lately.

Maybe I should rephrase that.

The moderators of /r/Funny have been hearing some concerns *about a specific topic* lately… and surprisingly, said topic is not in any way related to our questionable choices in hairstyles.

Basically, a large number of folks have pointed out that /r/Funny is dominated by comic strips nowadays… and that’s “dominated” in the sense of “populated predominantly by,” not the sense of “tied to a fence post and made to shout ‘Yes, Daddy!’ at passing mopeds.” 

Anyway, we’ve spent some time looking into this, and we’ve come to the conclusion that it’s true: At any given moment, over half of the subreddit’s top posts are comics. More often than not, two thirds of the visible content here has a four-panel nature.

This isn’t really a problem in and of itself – there are a number of very talented comic-creators here, and it’s clear that the community appreciates their work – but other submissions (especially those offered in unique or unfamiliar formats) are being eclipsed. In short, /r/Funny is slowly becoming a comic-focused subreddit instead of one devoted to all varieties of humorous content.

As such, we’re going to be experimenting with something new:

**Starting on June 16th, /r/Funny will attempt to annex Sealand.**

Wait, sorry, that’s… that’s a different thing.

Here we go:

**Starting on June 16th, Wednesdays will be comic-free days on /r/Funny.**

We’ll be testing this rule for several weeks, after which we’ll invite your feedback. At the same time, some adjustments will be made to the process for verifying comic-creators. (Authors who have already been verified will not be affected by this.) The wording of Rule 8 will be updated to reflect both of these changes, and [the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) will be restructured, as well.

As always, if you have questions or concerns (that are *not* focused on hairstyles), feel free to offer them!

On a completely unrelated note, does anyone have a battleship? We're asking for a friend."
